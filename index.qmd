Hello! My name is Natasha Zizic. I am a student at Colorado State University studying Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with a minor in Sociology. I am planning to graduate in May of 2025. I will continue my current position working in water quality, and eventually go back to school for a masters degree. I am passionate about ecological conservation and environmental justice, and Hope to implement these interests in my future career. Outside of my professional life, I have many outdoor hobbies, including hiking, camping and snowboarding. I also love to travel and explore different parts of the world.
